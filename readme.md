# GeminoAi

## Inspiration  
In today's fast-paced digital world, people often struggle to manage their time efficiently. From sifting through lengthy articles to crafting clear communication, many tasks can become overwhelming. We wanted to create a **one-place solution** that simplifies these challenges using AI, making everyday tasks easier and more accessible for everyone.

## What it does  
GeminoAi is a Chrome extension with four powerful features:  
1. **Chat Section**: A ChatGPT-like interface where users can ask questions or provide prompts and receive detailed answers.  
2. **Summarise Section**: Instantly summarises the content of the web page you are viewing, saving time and effort.  
3. **Translate Section**: Translates entered text into another language based on user chosen languages , with an added text-to-speech option for convenience.  
4. **Simplify Section**: Breaks down complex text into simpler versions, customised by tone and length chosen by the user.  

GeminoAi serves as a **one-place solution** for learning, communicating, and managing complex tasks with ease.

## How we built it  
GeminoAi leverages Chrome's built-in AI APIs:  
- **Prompt API** powers the Chat Section, enabling a conversational AI experience.  
- **Summarise API** handles summarising web pages with just a button click.  
- **Language Translation API** translates and vocalises entered text. 
- **Rewrite API** simplifies text by adjusting tone and length based on user preferences.  

We built the extension using modern web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Challenges we ran into  
Effectively integrating Chrome's built-in AI APIs was one of the most difficult tasks. The configuration needed for each API was unique, necessitating extensive testing and troubleshooting. Ensuring real-time responsiveness was another difficulty, particularly for streaming outputs like those seen in the Chat and Simplify sections.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We are pleased to have developed a useful, easy-to-use tool that provides a **one-place solution** for a variety of problems. GeminoAi is more than simply a project; it's a solution to practical issues like time management, accessibility enhancement, and learning simplification. We're genuinely thrilled with the achievement of successfully integrating several Chrome AI APIs into a single extension.

## What we learned  
Along the way, we discovered how to efficiently utilise Chrome's built-in AI APIs and tailor them to various tasks. Additionally, we developed our problem-solving and debugging abilities and learnt how to create modular, scalable web applications.

## What's next for GeminoAi  
We plan to expand GeminoAi by adding features like:  
- **Login System**: Introduce a login system with options like Google Login, enabling users to save their preferences and history securely in a database for a personalised experience.  
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Add voice input and output for better usability for all the sections. 

GeminoAi is just the beginning of what we envision as a smarter, AI-powered future for productivity and learning.
